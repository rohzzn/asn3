## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This project presents a novel visualization for tracking and understanding feature releases across software applications. Our approach combines temporal data (when features were released) with hierarchical categorical data (what types of features) in an intuitive, interactive visualization.

## ðŸš€ Design Evolution

Our design has evolved through several iterations, each building on learnings from the previous version:

### [V4: Quarterly Calendar with Embedded Treemaps](https://treemap.rohan.host/) (Final Version)
- Advanced visualization with treemaps embedded directly on release days
- Quarterly calendar layout for better temporal context
- Interactive exploration of feature categories
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rohzzn/asn3)

### [V3: Calendar Plus Treemap](https://zoom.rohan.host)
- Combined approach with calendar for temporal data and treemap for categories
- Hierarchical view of feature categories
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rohzzn/isse-treemap)

### [V2: Calendar with Heat Intensity](https://greenteam.rohan.host/)
- Enhanced calendar view with heat mapping to show release intensity
- Multi-application comparison
- Monthly and yearly views
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rohzzn/lsse)

### [V1: Calendar with Bubble Sort](http://teamgreen.rohan.host/)
- Initial design showing feature releases as bubbles on a calendar layout
- Bubble size indicates number of features released
- Color-coded bubbles for different applications
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rohzzn/features_visualization)

## ðŸ“Š Data Sources

The visualization uses release data from three major communication platforms:
- Zoom (571 features, Jan 2022 - Jan 2024)
- Firefox (171 features, Jan 2022 - Jan 2024)
- Webex (258 features, Jan 2022 - Dec 2023)

## ðŸ’» Technical Implementation

- Built with JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3
- Data processed using XLSX.js
- Interactive visualization with dynamic rendering
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## ðŸ‘¥ Team Members

Team Green members contributed to various aspects of this project, including:
- Data Analysis & Exploration

## ðŸ“š Research Foundations

Our visualization approach is based on established techniques from the information visualization field, including:
- Calendar-based temporal visualizations
- Treemap representations for hierarchical data
- Combined temporal-categorical visualization methods
